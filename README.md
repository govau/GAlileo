## About gov.au Observatory
The gov.au Observatory aims to quantify interactions with government services and support delivery teams to improve their own products and services. 
Using anonymous analytics data, we are creating prototypes that visualise user intent, language, behaviour and service outcomes. We want to show where individual services fit in to the broader environment.
We want government to deliver the best services it possibly can, and part of that is [measuring performance](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/11-measure-performance). The Observatory will help to give context and quantifiable measures to delivery teams striving to improve.

### Privacy
The Observatory does not:
- use any personally identifiable information (PII),
- sell data,
- provide data access to third parties unless strictly required under our [Terms of Service](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/google-analytics-government/dta-terms-service-google-analytics-360).

## About this repository
This repository contains our work in progress:
* /dags - Airflow data pipelines. See [Airflow 101](AIRFLOW101.md) for more information.
  * /docker - A docker image we use in data pipelines with R packages
* /notebooks - Juptyer notebooks of experiments in data analysis
* /scripts - SQL/R scripts we have used to extract data from Bigquery and other sources
* /html - A HTML based alpha prototype of a future web interface to the data
* /shiny - Interactive data exploration prototypes in R/Shiny

## Running the alpha prototype
### Using Observatory data (internal staff only)
To run the HTML version, download augov.gexf from /data on Google Cloud Storage, put it in html/observatory/data and run html/observatory/run.sh

### Using your own data 
We currently use a customised version of Gephi's .gexf file format, adding a "domain" column. 
You may be able to use a tool like [HttpGraph](https://gephi.org/plugins/#/plugin/httpgraph) as a starting point to create your own.
